# PlantoScope
PlantoScope is a mobile application that uses deep learning to detect plant diseases from leaf images. Designed to support farmers, agriculturists, and researchers, the app enables users to capture or upload images of plant leaves, which are then analyzed using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
